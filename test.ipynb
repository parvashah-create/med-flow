In patients with a risk of bleeding, a physician should weigh the risks of lepirudin administration against its benefits.  There is also an especially high risk of bleeding in patients who weigh less than 50 kg, and a lower dosage is required. Patients with renal impairment have a higher risk of hemorrhagic adverse events.[L41539]\n",

Active thrombin cleaves fibrinogen and generates fibrin monomers that polymerize to form fibrin clots.[A246624]\n",

After 3 months, hemosiderin deposits in the spleen and moderate sinus histiocytosis in the lymph node were observed in rats. In monkeys, external and internal hemorrhages and hematomas were detected.[L41539] Lepidurin was reported as not mutagenic.[L41539]\n",

Lepirudin has no known antidote. In case of life-threatening bleeding and if excessive plasma levels of lepirudin are suspected: 1)stop the administration of lepirudin immediately, 2) determine aPTT and coagulation parameters, 3) determine hemoglobin, and prepare for a transfusion, 4) follow the treatment guidelines for patients with shock.[L41539] Hemofiltration or hemodialysis may be useful in case of overdose, based in single case reports and animal data.[L41539]\n",

In healthy elderly subjects (n=10, 65-80 years), clearance was 139 mL/min, about 20% lower than in younger patients.[L41539] This is possibly due to the lower creatinine clearance in elderly patients.

Each molecule of lepirudin binds to a single molecule of thrombin,[L41539] and unlike [heparin], it is able to inhibit thrombin in both its clot-bound or free states.[A246609]', 'toxicity': 'The acute toxicity of intravenous lepirudin was evaluated in mice (0.1-1000 mg/kg), rats (1-1000 mg/kg), and monkeys (1-100 mg/kg), and toxicity was not detected at the doses investigated.[L41539] The acute toxicity of lepirudin administered subcutaneously was also evaluated in mice (1-1250 mg/kg) and rats (1-500 mg/kg), and no toxicity was detected.[L41539] One rat (100 mg/kg) died of rapid blood loss after the subcutaneous administration of lepirudin. Reactions to local injections such as hemorrhages, hematomas and/or nodules were detected in mice and rats given subcutaneous doses of lepirudin equal or higher than 500 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively.[L41539] \\r\\n      \\r\\n      Chronic toxicity was evaluated in rats and monkeys given lepirudin for up to 3 months. Most of the effects observed were due to the antithrombotic action of lepirudin. After 3 months, hemosiderin deposits in the spleen and moderate sinus histiocytosis in the lymph node were observed in rats. In monkeys, external and internal hemorrhages and hematomas were detected.[L41539] Lepidurin was reported as not mutagenic.[L41539]\\r\\n      \\r\\n      Relative overdose may occur in patients with renal impairment, therefore, bolus dose and rate of infusion must be reduced in case of known or suspected renal insufficiency.[L41539] Excessively high activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values suggest an overdose and a risk of bleeding. Lepirudin has no known antidote. In case of life-threatening bleeding and if excessive plasma levels of lepirudin are suspected: 1)stop the administration of lepirudin immediately, 2) determine aPTT and coagulation parameters, 3) determine hemoglobin, and prepare for a transfusion, 4) follow the treatment guidelines for patients with shock.[L41539] Hemofiltration or hemodialysis may be useful in case of overdose, based in single case reports and animal data.[L41539]', 'metabolism': 'As a polypeptide, lepirudin is expected to be metabolized by the sequential cleavage of amino acids by kidney exoproteases, which have carboxypeptidase and dipeptidase-like activity.[L41539,L41544] The C-terminal cleavage of lepirudin aminoacids (aminoacids 1 to 65) produces four metabolites with anti-thrombotic activity: M1 (aminoacids 1 to 64), M2 (aminoacids 1 to 63), M3 (aminoacids 1 to 62), and M4 (aminoacids 1 to 61).[L41544]', 'absorption': 'Lepirudin administered as a single intravenous bolus injection of 0.4 mg/kg in 9 healthy volunteers (male and female) resulted in a C<sub>max</sub> of 2924 ng/mL, a t<sub>max</sub> of 0.17 h and an AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> of 2500 ng•h/mL.[L41539] When 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 mg/kg of lepirudin was administered as a single intravenous infusion over 6 hours in healthy male volunteers, lepirudin had a corresponding C<sub>max</sub> of 111, 203, and 2446 ng/mL and a corresponding AUC of 612, 1184, and 1446 ng•h/mL.[L41544] Bioavailability is 100% following injection. Also, it has been reported that following subcutaneous (sc) administration, the bioavailability of lepirudin is almost 100%.[A246609]', 'half-life': 'Lepirudin has an initial half-life of approximately 10 minutes, and in young healthy volunteers, it has a terminal half-time of 1.3 hours.[L41539] Lepirudin has a first-order elimination kinetic; plasma concentration increases proportionally as the lepirudin intravenous dose is increased. Elimination half-life values of up to 2 days were detected in patients with marked renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min).[L41539]', 'protein-binding': 'In human plasma, the protein binding of lepirudin was approximately 3%.[L41539]', 'route-of-elimination': 'Lepirudin is mostly excreted through urine (48.3%). About 35% of lepirudin is excreted unchanged, while metabolites are found in a smaller proportion (2.5% of M1, 5.4% of M2, 3.9% of M3 and 1.6% of M4).[L41544]', 'volume-of-distribution': 'The volume of distribution of lepirudin at steady state was 12.2 L in healthy young subjects (n=18, 18-60 years), 18.7 L in healthy elderly subjects (n=10, 65-80 years), 18.0 L in renally impaired subjects (n=16, creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min, and 32.1 L in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients (n=73).[L41539] The distribution of lepirudin is mainly restricted to extracellular fluids.[L41539]', 'clearance': 'The clearance of lepirudin is proportional to the glomerular filtration rate. On average, lepirudin clearance was 164 mL/min in healthy young subjects (n=18, 18-60 years) and 25% lower in women than in men. In healthy elderly subjects (n=10, 65-80 years), clearance was 139 mL/min, about 20% lower than in younger patients.[L41539] This is possibly due to the lower creatinine clearance in elderly patients. In renally impaired subjects (n=16, creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min), clearance was 61 mL/min, and in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients (n=73), it was 114 mL/min.[L41539]'}\n"

Its activity is measured by anti-thrombin units (ATUs) that correspond to the amount of lepirudin required to neutralize a unit of the World Health Organization α-thrombin (89/588) standard. The activity of lepirudin is 16,000 ATU/mg.[L41539,L41569] A single molecule of lepirudin binds to a molecule of thrombin, blocking its thrombogenic activity. This drug increases activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)  and PT (INR) values in a dose-dependent manner, and its mode of action is independent of antithrombin III.[L41539,L41569] Platelet factor 4 does not inhibit lepirudin.[L41539,L41569]\\r\\n      \\r\\n      The pharmacodynamic effect of lepirudin was evaluated by measuring an increase in aPTT. No saturable effect was observed at the highest tested dose (0.5 mg/kg, IV bolus).[L41539] Thrombin time was considered an unsuitable routine test for lepirudin monitoring due to the high values detected (200 seconds) even at low doses.[L41539] The concomitant use of thrombolytic therapy and lepirudin is not recommended due to the high risk of bleeding that may be life-threatening. In patients with a risk of bleeding, a physician should weigh the risks of lepirudin administration against its benefits.  There is also an especially high risk of bleeding in patients who weigh less than 50 kg, and a lower dosage is required. Patients with renal impairment have a higher risk of hemorrhagic adverse events.[L41539]',\n",
    " 'mechanism-of-action': 'Lepirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor used as an anticoagulant in patients for whom heparin is contraindicated.[L41539,A3] Thrombin is a serine protease that participates in the blood-clotting cascade, and it is formed by the cleavage of pro-thrombin. Active thrombin cleaves fibrinogen and generates fibrin monomers that polymerize to form fibrin clots.[A246624]\\r\\n      \\r\\n      Lepirudin binds to the catalytic and substrate-binding sites of thrombin, forming a stable, irreversible and non-covalent complex.[A246609] This blocks the protease activity of thrombin and inhibits the coagulation process. Each molecule of lepirudin binds to a single molecule of thrombin,[L41539] and unlike [heparin], it is able to inhibit thrombin in both its clot-bound or free states.[A246609]',\n",
    " 'toxicity': 'The acute toxicity of intravenous lepirudin was evaluated in mice (0.1-1000 mg/kg), rats (1-1000 mg/kg), and monkeys (1-100 mg/kg), and toxicity was not detected at the doses investigated.[L41539] The acute toxicity of lepirudin administered subcutaneously was also evaluated in mice (1-1250 mg/kg) and rats (1-500 mg/kg), and no toxicity was detected.[L41539] One rat (100 mg/kg) died of rapid blood loss after the subcutaneous administration of lepirudin. Reactions to local injections such as hemorrhages, hematomas and/or nodules were detected in mice and rats given subcutaneous doses of lepirudin equal or higher than 500 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively.[L41539] \\r\\n      \\r\\n      Chronic toxicity was evaluated in rats and monkeys given lepirudin for up to 3 months. Most of the effects observed were due to the antithrombotic action of lepirudin. After 3 months, hemosiderin deposits in the spleen and moderate sinus histiocytosis in the lymph node were observed in rats. In monkeys, external and internal hemorrhages and hematomas were detected.[L41539] Lepidurin was reported as not mutagenic.[L41539]\\r\\n      \\r\\n      Relative overdose may occur in patients with renal impairment, therefore, bolus dose and rate of infusion must be reduced in case of known or suspected renal insufficiency.[L41539] Excessively high activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values suggest an overdose and a risk of bleeding. Lepirudin has no known antidote. In case of life-threatening bleeding and if excessive plasma levels of lepirudin are suspected: 1)stop the administration of lepirudin immediately, 2) determine aPTT and coagulation parameters, 3) determine hemoglobin, and prepare for a transfusion, 4) follow the treatment guidelines for patients with shock.[L41539] Hemofiltration or hemodialysis may be useful in case of overdose, based in single case reports and animal data.[L41539]',\n",
    " 'metabolism': 'As a polypeptide, lepirudin is expected to be metabolized by the sequential cleavage of amino acids by kidney exoproteases, which have carboxypeptidase and dipeptidase-like activity.[L41539,L41544] The C-terminal cleavage of lepirudin aminoacids (aminoacids 1 to 65) produces four metabolites with anti-thrombotic activity: M1 (aminoacids 1 to 64), M2 (aminoacids 1 to 63), M3 (aminoacids 1 to 62), and M4 (aminoacids 1 to 61).[L41544]',\n",
    " 'absorption': 'Lepirudin administered as a single intravenous bolus injection of 0.4 mg/kg in 9 healthy volunteers (male and female) resulted in a C<sub>max</sub> of 2924 ng/mL, a t<sub>max</sub> of 0.17 h and an AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> of 2500 ng•h/mL.[L41539] When 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 mg/kg of lepirudin was administered as a single intravenous infusion over 6 hours in healthy male volunteers, lepirudin had a corresponding C<sub>max</sub> of 111, 203, and 2446 ng/mL and a corresponding AUC of 612, 1184, and 1446 ng•h/mL.[L41544] Bioavailability is 100% following injection. Also, it has been reported that following subcutaneous (sc) administration, the bioavailability of lepirudin is almost 100%.[A246609]',\n",
    " 'half-life': 'Lepirudin has an initial half-life of approximately 10 minutes, and in young healthy volunteers, it has a terminal half-time of 1.3 hours.[L41539] Lepirudin has a first-order elimination kinetic; plasma concentration increases proportionally as the lepirudin intravenous dose is increased. Elimination half-life values of up to 2 days were detected in patients with marked renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min).[L41539]',\n",
    " 'protein-binding': 'In human plasma, the protein binding of lepirudin was approximately 3%.[L41539]',\n",
    " 'route-of-elimination': 'Lepirudin is mostly excreted through urine (48.3%). About 35% of lepirudin is excreted unchanged, while metabolites are found in a smaller proportion (2.5% of M1, 5.4% of M2, 3.9% of M3 and 1.6% of M4).[L41544]',\n",
    " 'volume-of-distribution': 'The volume of distribution of lepirudin at steady state was 12.2 L in healthy young subjects (n=18, 18-60 years), 18.7 L in healthy elderly subjects (n=10, 65-80 years), 18.0 L in renally impaired subjects (n=16, creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min, and 32.1 L in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients (n=73).[L41539] The distribution of lepirudin is mainly restricted to extracellular fluids.[L41539]',\n",
    " 'clearance': 'The clearance of lepirudin is proportional to the glomerular filtration rate. On average, lepirudin clearance was 164 mL/min in healthy young subjects (n=18, 18-60 years) and 25% lower in women than in men. In healthy elderly subjects (n=10, 65-80 years), clearance was 139 mL/min, about 20% lower than in younger patients.[L41539] This is possibly due to the lower creatinine clearance in elderly patients. In renally impaired subjects (n=16, creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min), clearance was 61 mL/min, and in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients (n=73), it was 114 mL/min.[L41539]'\n",
